# About Game
I created this game while learning love2d, so I do not recommend using the game's source code for learning love. </br>
The game was never completed and remained on my hard drive for a long time. </br>
Certainly, in the state in which the source code is, it would be best not to share it at all, but I want to keep this project open. </br>
This game represents my introduction to love2d, a wonderful framework for game development.
